## 🚧 Work in Progress

This portfolio is updated weekly. Each folder will include:
- `README.md` – Lab summary and reflections  
- `report.md` – Vulnerability write-up with CVSS scoring  
- `screenshots/` – Evidence from Postman, Burp, 42Crunch  
- `poc/` – Proof-of-concept requests and scripts

Stay tuned as I build out each week and complete the full 12-week journey.
